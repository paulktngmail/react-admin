   - Token metadata retrieval
   - Token supply verification
   - Token transfer functionality
   - Token minting functionality
   - Token burning functionality
   - Presale time extension

2. **AWS DynamoDB Integration**
   - Wallet operations (add, get, update, delete)
   - Transaction operations (add, get, list)
   - Metadata operations (store, get, update)
   - Presale information storage and retrieval
   - Whitelist management with email addresses
   - Direct integration with the 'dpnetsale' table

3. **AWS RDS Integration**
   - User operations (create, get, update, delete)
   - Presale operations (create, get, update, list)
   - Token info operations (store, get, update)
   - Join query operations for relational data

## Testing Scripts

1. **Token-Specific Tests**
   - Tests for token metadata
   - Tests for token supply
   - Tests for token transfer
   - Tests for token minting
   - Tests for token burning

2. **DynamoDB Integration Tests**
   - Tests for DynamoDB connection
   - Tests for wallet table operations
   - Tests for transaction table operations
   - Tests for metadata table operations
   - Tests for query performance

3. **RDS Integration Tests**
   - Tests for database connection
   - Tests for user table operations
   - Tests for presale table operations
   - Tests for token info table operations
   - Tests for join queries

## Backend Server

A dedicated Express.js backend server has been implemented to handle API requests and interact with AWS services:

1. **API Endpoints**
   - Presale information retrieval and management
   - Token operations (transfer, mint, burn)
   - Whitelist management (add, remove, bulk operations)
   - Testing endpoints for integration testing

2. **DynamoDB Integration**
   - Direct connection to DynamoDB using AWS SDK
   - Table operations for presale, whitelist, and transactions
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Automatic creation of default data if not present

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Environment variables for AWS credentials and region
   - Table name configuration
   - Server port configuration

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment using AWS Amplify, with the necessary configuration files in place:

- `amplify.yml` for build settings
- Environment variables for API endpoints and token addresses
- GitHub integration for continuous deployment
- Backend server deployment with proper AWS credentials

## Future Enhancements

1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Add role-based access control
   - Enhance transaction signing security
   - Further improve Sybil attack detection and prevention

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Improve real-time data updates

3. **Additional Features**
   - Token analytics dashboard with advanced metrics
   - Transaction monitoring tools with filtering capabilities
   - Automated reporting with scheduled delivery
   - Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go management

## Conclusion

The DPNET-10 Admin Dashboard provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the DPNET-10 token presale on the Solana blockchain. The implementation includes specialized presale overview and management features, enhanced whitelist management with search and bulk operations, backend integration with Solana and AWS services, and testing scripts to ensure functionality. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly while providing powerful tools for presale administration.
