# Implementation Summary: Solana Blockchain Integration

## Problem

The React admin dashboard needed to display real-time data from the Solana blockchain, but there were issues with the build process due to incompatibilities between the Solana libraries and the React build system.

## Solution

We implemented a backend-frontend architecture to solve this problem:

### 1. Backend API Server

- Created a dedicated Node.js Express server (`backend/solana-api.js`) that handles all direct Solana blockchain interactions
- The backend server exposes RESTful API endpoints for all required blockchain operations:
  - Token balances
  - Token supply
  - Transaction counts
  - Transaction history
  - Pool data (presale, rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, treasury)
  - Token information
- The backend server uses the Solana libraries (`@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token`) directly, avoiding any build-time issues

### 2. Frontend Integration

- Updated the frontend Solana API service (`src/services/solanaApi.js`) to use Axios to communicate with the backend API
- Removed direct Solana library dependencies from the frontend build process
- Created a build-specific version (`src/services/solanaApi.build.js`) for the build process
- Configured webpack to use the build version during production builds

### 3. Build Configuration

- Added a webpack configuration to handle the Solana libraries properly
- Created a custom Babel configuration
- Used react-app-rewired to override the default Create React App configuration
- Added necessary polyfills for Node.js modules used by Solana libraries

## Results

- The application now successfully fetches real-time data from the Solana blockchain
- The build process completes without errors
- The frontend displays actual blockchain data instead of static mock data
- The architecture is more maintainable and scalable

## How to Run

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   node solana-api.js
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. The frontend will connect to the backend API server, which in turn connects to the Solana blockchain to fetch real-time data.

## Future Improvements

- Add caching to reduce the number of blockchain queries
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add authentication to the backend API
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for blockchain connections
