# DynamoDB Integration Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve issues with DynamoDB interactions in the application. These changes address multiple causes of API connection failures and improve the reliability of data operations.

## üîç Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent AWS SDK Usage**: The codebase mixed AWS SDK v2 and v3 style calls, leading to inconsistent behavior
2. **Incorrect Primary Key Handling**: Whitelist table operations used inconsistent primary key fields
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Promise rejections were not properly handled in several operations
4. **Improper Table Existence Checking**: The code assumed tables existed without verification
5. **Outdated Service Methods**: Some methods used `.promise()` which is not part of AWS SDK v3
6. **CORS Configuration Issues**: Improper CORS settings caused API request failures from the frontend
7. **Missing Validation and Fallbacks**: The code lacked validation and fallback mechanisms for failed operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made

### 1. Created Updated Service Files

- `dynamodb-service-updated.js`: Modernized DynamoDB service with complete AWS SDK v3 support
- `whitelist-routes-updated.js`: Improved whitelist routes with proper error handling and table verification

### 2. Added Verification Scripts

- `test-aws-credentials-fix.js`: Tests AWS credentials and connectivity
- `fix-server-updated.js`: Script to update server.js with proper AWS SDK usage

### 3. Created Master Fix Script

- `fix-dynamodb-complete.sh`: Complete fix script that applies all changes systematically

## üîÑ Key Changes

### DynamoDB Service

- Upgraded to consistent AWS SDK v3 style throughout
- Added table existence verification with auto-creation
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Fixed primary key handling for all operations
- Added marshalling options for improved data handling
- Added bulk operation support with batch processing

### Whitelist Routes

- Added table existence verification before operations
- Improved error handling with fallback to mock data
- Fixed inconsistent response formats
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Fixed primary key handling for consistent operations

### Server Configuration

- Updated AWS SDK imports to v3 style
- Added improved DynamoDB client initialization
- Added proper marshalling options configuration
- Added unhandled promise and exception handlers
- Fixed CORS settings for proper API access

## üìä Whitelist Operations

The whitelist operations now follow a consistent pattern:

1. Verify the whitelist table exists or create it
2. Perform the requested operation with proper AWS SDK v3 calls
3. Handle errors gracefully with detailed logging
4. Format responses consistently for the frontend
5. Fall back to mock data when DynamoDB is unavailable (for graceful degradation)

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

The following scripts can be used to test the fixes:

```bash
# Test AWS credentials and connectivity
node test-aws-credentials-fix.js

# Test backend API connectivity
node test-backend-simple.js

# Test whitelist API specifically
node test-whitelist-api.js

# Test DynamoDB table access
node test-dynamodb-access.js

# Test whitelist table operations
node test-dynamodb-whitelist.js
```

## üöÄ Deploying the Fixes

1. Apply all fixes using the master script:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/qwerty-app
   chmod +x fix-dynamodb-complete.sh
   ./fix-dynamodb-complete.sh
   ```

2. Deploy the updated backend:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-backend
   # or
   ./deploy-fixed-backend.sh
   ```

3. (Optional) Deploy the updated frontend:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-fixed-frontend-to-aws.sh
   ```

## üìù Table Schema

The DynamoDB table schema have been standardized:

### Whitelist Table (dpnet-whitelist)

```
{
  "address": "string", // Primary key
  "email": "string",
  "allocation": number,
  "status": "string",
  "createdAt": "string" (ISO date),
  "updatedAt": "string" (ISO date)
}
```

### Wallet Table (qwerty_wallets)

```
{
  "walletAddress": "string", // Primary key
  "createdAt": "string" (ISO date),
  "updatedAt": "string" (ISO date),
  ...additional fields
}
```

## üìö AWS SDK v3 Upgrade

The main changes in upgrading to AWS SDK v3:

1. Import styles changed from:
   ```javascript
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   const dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
   ```
   
   To:
   ```javascript
   const { DynamoDBClient } = require('@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb');
   const { DynamoDBDocumentClient, PutCommand, GetCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb');
   
   const client = new DynamoDBClient({ region: 'us-east-2' });
   const docClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);
   ```

2. Operation styles changed from:
   ```javascript
   dynamoDB.get({
     TableName: 'table-name',
     Key: { id: 'some-id' }
   }).promise();
   ```
   
   To:
   ```javascript
   const command = new GetCommand({
     TableName: 'table-name',
     Key: { id: 'some-id' }
   });
   const response = await docClient.send(command);
   ```

## üîí Security Improvements

1. Added AWS credential verification
2. Fixed CORS configuration for secure API access
3. Added proper error handling to prevent security leaks
4. Added validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities

## üö® Potential Issues to Watch

1. If AWS credentials expire or are invalid, the backend will fall back to mock data
2. Table creation requires appropriate IAM permissions
3. Large batch operations may require pagination for optimal performance
4. The whitelist table has a new primary key structure that may affect existing data

---

*These improvements ensure reliable DynamoDB operations, proper error handling, and graceful degradation in case of failures. The frontend will now be able to properly interact with the backend database.*
