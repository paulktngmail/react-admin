# API Communication Fix Summary

## Overview

I've identified and fixed multiple issues causing the API communication problems between your frontend and backend. This document summarizes the changes made and provides instructions for deploying the solution.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: Updated frontend code to handle HTTPS to HTTP communication properly
2. **API Path Inconsistencies**: Fixed endpoint paths in API requests
3. **Multiple API Request Approaches**: Created a unified API service
4. **Proxy Configuration Issues**: Improved proxy settings in setupProxy.js and amplify.yml
5. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling in API requests
6. **CORS Configuration**: Updated CORS settings to allow requests from the frontend
7. **Redirect Configuration**: Fixed Netlify _redirects file configuration
8. **Deployment Process**: Created comprehensive deployment scripts

## Key Files Updated

1. **src/direct-api.js**: Changed to use relative URLs instead of absolute URLs
2. **src/services/solanaApi.js**: Improved API request handling
3. **src/setupProxy.js**: Added better error handling and logging
4. **amplify.yml**: Updated proxy configuration to allow HTTPS to HTTP proxying
5. **public/_redirects**: Ensured proper API request handling
6. **API_COMMUNICATION_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Updated with comprehensive documentation

## New Files Created

1. **src/services/unified-api.js**: A standardized API service with proper error handling
2. **push-and-deploy-complete-solution.sh**: A deployment script for the complete solution
3. **push-and-deploy-complete-solution-with-auth.sh**: A deployment script with GitHub authentication
4. **test-backend-simple.js**: A test script for the backend API
5. **test-frontend-proxy.js**: A test script for the frontend proxy
6. **test-deployed-frontend-api.js**: A test script for the deployed frontend
7. **COMPREHENSIVE_API_FIX_SOLUTION.md**: Detailed documentation of all issues and solutions

## Deployment Instructions

Since the direct deployment to AWS Amplify failed, we need to push the changes to GitHub and let AWS Amplify automatically deploy from there.

### Option 1: Without Authentication

If you don't need authentication for GitHub:

```bash
./push-and-deploy-complete-solution.sh
```

### Option 2: With Authentication

If you need authentication for GitHub:

```bash
./push-and-deploy-complete-solution-with-auth.sh
```

This script will prompt you for your GitHub username and personal access token.

## Testing

After deployment, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running:

```bash
# Test the backend API directly
node test-backend-simple.js

# Test the deployed frontend's API access
node test-deployed-frontend-api.js
```

## Monitoring

You can monitor the deployment status in:

1. **AWS Amplify Console**: Check the build and deployment status
2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console**: Check the backend deployment status

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **GitHub Push Issues**: Use the authentication version of the script
2. **Backend Deployment Issues**: Check the Elastic Beanstalk logs
3. **Frontend Deployment Issues**: Check the AWS Amplify build logs
4. **API Communication Issues**: Run the test scripts to identify the problem

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the AWS Amplify deployment to ensure it completes successfully
2. Verify that the frontend can communicate with the backend
3. Test all functionality to ensure everything is working correctly

The core issues have been resolved, and the application should now be able to communicate properly between the frontend and backend.
