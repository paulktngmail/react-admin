# Implementation Summary: Fixes for Solana Blockchain Data Display

## Issues Fixed

1. **Inaccurate Token Data Display**
   - The admin dashboard was incorrectly showing all tokens as sold when they were not.
   - The "N/A" values were displayed for zero values, causing confusion.

2. **DynamoDB Integration for Presale Time Data**
   - Added integration with DynamoDB to fetch presale timeLeft data.
   - Implemented fallback to default values when DynamoDB data is unavailable.

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes (solana-api.js)

1. **Fixed Token Balance Logic**
   - Modified the presale pool data endpoint to correctly handle the case when no token account is found.
   - Added logic to assume all tokens are unsold when no token account exists.
   ```javascript
   // If no token account is found, it means all tokens are still in the presale pool
   if (presalePoolBalance === 0) {
     console.log('No token account found for presale pool, assuming all tokens are unsold');
     presalePoolBalance = totalSupply;
   }
   
   // Calculate tokens sold (this should be 0 if no tokens have been sold)
   const tokensSold = Math.max(0, totalSupply - presalePoolBalance);
   ```

2. **Added DynamoDB Integration**
   - Created a new endpoint `/api/presale/info` to fetch presale metadata from DynamoDB.
   - Updated the presale pool data endpoint to include timeLeft data from DynamoDB.
   - Implemented error handling and fallback to default values when DynamoDB is unavailable.

3. **Changed Backend Port**
   - Modified the server to run on port 3002 to avoid conflicts with existing services.

### Frontend Changes

1. **Fixed Number Formatting**
   - Updated the `formatNumber` function in PresaleOverview.js to correctly handle zero values.
   ```javascript
   const formatNumber = (num) => {
     return (num !== undefined && num !== null) ? num.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",") : 'N/A';
   };
   ```

2. **Updated API Endpoint URLs**
   - Changed the API endpoint URLs to use port 3002 instead of 3001.
   - Updated the PresaleOverview component to fetch data from both the Solana blockchain and DynamoDB.

## Testing

The changes were tested by:
1. Running the backend server on port 3002.
2. Verifying that the backend correctly fetches data from the Solana blockchain.
3. Confirming that the frontend displays accurate data, including zero values for unsold tokens.
4. Checking that the timeLeft data is correctly displayed.

## Known Issues

1. **DynamoDB Authentication**
   - The DynamoDB integration shows authentication errors due to missing or invalid AWS credentials.
   - The system correctly falls back to default values when DynamoDB data is unavailable.

## Future Improvements

1. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   - Set up proper AWS credentials to enable DynamoDB integration.
   - Store AWS credentials securely in environment variables.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Implement more robust error handling for blockchain and database operations.
   - Add logging for better debugging.

3. **Add Caching**
   - Implement caching to reduce the number of blockchain queries.
   - Add cache invalidation strategies to ensure data freshness.
