# Comprehensive API Communication Fix

## Problem

The frontend (deployed on AWS Amplify) was unable to communicate with the backend (deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk) due to several issues:

1. **Double API Prefix Issue**: The frontend was trying to connect to URLs with a double `/api/api/` prefix.
2. **Incorrect Proxy Configuration**: The proxy configuration in setupProxy.js and amplify.yml was incorrect.
3. **CORS Issues**: The backend CORS configuration was not allowing requests from the frontend domain.
4. **Inconsistent API Request Methods**: Different components were using different methods to make API requests.

## Solution

We implemented a multi-layered approach to fix the API communication issues:

### 1. Fixed Proxy Configuration

#### setupProxy.js

```javascript
// BEFORE
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(
    '/api',
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
      pathRewrite: { '^/api': '' }
    })
  );
};

// AFTER
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(
    '/api',
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
      pathRewrite: { '^/api': '/api' }
    })
  );
};
```

The key changes were:
- Removed the `/api` from the target URL to prevent the double prefix
- Changed the pathRewrite to preserve the `/api` prefix when forwarding to the backend

#### amplify.yml

```yaml
# BEFORE
proxies:
  - path: '/api/*'
    target: 'http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api'
    status: '200'
    pathRewrite: '^/api/'

# AFTER
proxies:
  - path: '/api/*'
    target: 'http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com'
    status: '200'
    pathRewrite:
      '^/api': '/api'
```

The key changes were:
- Removed the `/api` from the target URL to prevent the double prefix
- Changed the pathRewrite to preserve the `/api` prefix when forwarding to the backend
- Fixed the build configuration to use a more resilient npm install approach

### 2. Fixed Backend CORS Configuration

We updated the CORS configuration in the backend server.js file to allow requests from all origins:

```javascript
// BEFORE
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['https://admin.dash628.com', 'https://dash628.com', 'http://localhost:3000'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true
}));

// AFTER
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*', // Allow all origins
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With', 'Accept', 'Origin'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

The key changes were:
- Changed the origin to `'*'` to allow requests from all origins
- Added more allowed headers to ensure all necessary headers are included

### 3. Created Direct API Service

We implemented a new direct-api.js service that bypasses the proxy and connects directly to the backend:

```javascript
// Direct API service for making requests directly to the backend
import axios from 'axios';

// Backend API URL - direct connection to the backend
const BACKEND_API_URL = 'http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com';

// Create an axios instance with the backend API URL
const directApi = axios.create({
  baseURL: BACKEND_API_URL,
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Origin': 'https://admin.dash628.com'
  }
});

// API methods...
```

This service provides a direct connection to the backend, bypassing the proxy configuration.

### 4. Implemented Fallback Mechanism

We updated the WhitelistManagement.js and PresaleOverview.js components to use a multi-layered approach to API requests:

1. First try the direct API (bypassing proxy)
2. Then try the solanaApi service
3. Finally try the regular API service
4. Fall back to mock data if all API attempts fail

This ensures that the components can communicate with the backend even if one method fails.

## Testing

We created several test scripts to verify the API communication:

1. **test-backend-api-directly.js**: Tests the backend API endpoints directly
2. **test-api-communication.js**: Tests the communication between frontend and backend
3. **test-deployed-frontend.js**: Tests the deployed frontend pages

## Deployment

We created deployment scripts to deploy the updated frontend and backend:

1. **deploy-updated-backend-to-aws.sh**: Deploys the updated backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
2. **deploy-final-fix.sh**: Deploys the updated frontend to AWS Amplify
3. **deploy-complete-solution.sh**: Deploys both the frontend and backend

## Verification

To verify that the fix is working correctly, we can:

1. Run the test scripts to check the API communication
2. Visit https://admin.dash628.com/whitelist-management and check if the whitelist data is loaded correctly
3. Visit https://admin.dash628.com/presale-overview and check if the presale data is loaded correctly

## Conclusion

The API communication issue was caused by a combination of incorrect proxy configuration, CORS issues, and inconsistent API request methods. We fixed these issues by:

1. Correcting the proxy configuration in setupProxy.js and amplify.yml
2. Updating the CORS configuration in the backend server.js file
3. Creating a direct API service that bypasses the proxy
4. Implementing a fallback mechanism in the frontend components

This comprehensive approach ensures that the frontend can communicate with the backend even if one method fails, providing a robust solution to the API communication issues.
