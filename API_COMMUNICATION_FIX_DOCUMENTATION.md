# API Communication Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve communication issues between the frontend and backend of the Dash628 application. Multiple issues were identified and addressed to ensure proper data flow between the React frontend and the Node.js backend.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration

**Issue:** The backend CORS configuration was not allowing requests from `https://www.dash628.com`.

**Fix:** Updated the CORS configuration in `server.js` to include all necessary origins:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: ['https://admin.dash628.com', 'https://www.dash628.com', 'http://localhost:3000'],
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Origin', 'X-Requested-With', 'Accept'],
    credentials: true
}));
```

### 2. DynamoDB Key Structure Mismatch

**Issue:** The whitelist API endpoints were using inconsistent key structures:
- Some functions expected `address` as the key
- Others were looking for `walletAddress`
- The database was using different field names than the API

**Fix:** Standardized all DynamoDB operations in `whitelist-routes.js` to use consistent key structure:
- Used `id` as the primary key in DynamoDB
- Ensured `address` field is consistently used in all operations
- Updated all query parameters to match the database schema

### 3. API Endpoint Path Mismatches

**Issue:** The frontend was using `/api/pool/whitelist` but some backend routes were only registered at `/api/whitelist`.

**Fix:** Added dual route registration to support both path patterns:

```javascript
// Support both API paths for compatibility
app.get('/api/whitelist', getWhitelistedUsers);
app.get('/api/pool/whitelist', getWhitelistedUsers);
```

This ensures that requests work regardless of which path pattern is used.

### 4. Bulk Add Whitelist Function

**Issue:** The bulk add whitelist function was creating entries with `address` field but the database was expecting `walletAddress`.

**Fix:** Updated the bulk add function to use consistent field names:

```javascript
const putParams = {
  TableName: WHITELIST_TABLE,
  Item: {
    id: address,
    address: address,
    allocation: allocation || 0,
    status: 'Active',
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
  }
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. Created a fixed version of the whitelist routes in `whitelist-routes-fixed.js`
2. Implemented a shell script `fix-dynamodb-communication.sh` to apply the fixes
3. Deployed the updated backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Frontend Changes

1. Built the frontend with the latest changes
2. Pushed the frontend to GitHub for deployment to AWS Amplify

## Testing

The fixes were tested using:

1. Direct API testing against the backend endpoints
2. Frontend-to-backend integration testing
3. End-to-end testing with the deployed application

## Deployment

- Backend: Deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at `http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com`
- Frontend: Pushed to GitHub for automatic deployment via AWS Amplify

## Verification

To verify the fixes:

1. Visit https://www.dash628.com
2. Confirm that whitelist data loads correctly
3. Test adding and removing addresses from the whitelist
4. Verify that all Solana API data displays correctly

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement more comprehensive error handling
2. Add automated tests for API endpoints
3. Consider implementing a more robust database schema with consistent key naming
4. Add monitoring for API failures to catch issues early
