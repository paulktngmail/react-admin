# API Communication Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **Protocol Mismatch**
   - Changed HTTPS to HTTP in the API endpoint URLs
   - Updated the `_redirects` file to use HTTP for the backend API
   - Modified the direct API service to use the absolute HTTP URL

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Fixed the CORS configuration in the backend server
   - Added `https://www.dash628.com` to the allowed origins
   - Updated the Origin header in API requests to match the frontend domain

3. **Whitelist Routes**
   - Fixed the whitelist routes to use consistent field names
   - Ensured proper handling of the `address` field in all operations
   - Implemented proper error handling for whitelist operations

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **CORS Configuration Fix**
   - Created a JavaScript-based fix for the CORS configuration
   - Properly updated the allowed origins to include `https://www.dash628.com`
   - Fixed the CORS configuration without breaking the server syntax

2. **Whitelist Routes Fix**
   - Implemented a proper fix for the whitelist routes
   - Ensured consistent field names across all operations
   - Added proper error handling for all whitelist operations

### Frontend Changes

1. **API Endpoint Protocol Fix**
   - Updated the `_redirects` file to use HTTP for the backend API
   - Modified the direct API service to use the absolute HTTP URL
   - Updated the Origin header to match the frontend domain

2. **Direct API Service**
   - Changed the API URL from HTTPS to HTTP
   - Updated the Origin header to `https://www.dash628.com`
   - Ensured proper error handling for all API operations

## Testing

The following tests were performed to verify the fixes:

1. **Backend API Test**
   - Verified the backend API is accessible via HTTP
   - Confirmed the whitelist API endpoints are working correctly
   - Tested both `/api/whitelist` and `/api/pool/whitelist` paths

2. **Frontend API Test**
   - Built and deployed the frontend with the updated API configuration
   - Verified the frontend can communicate with the backend
   - Confirmed the whitelist management page loads data correctly

## Deployment

1. **Backend Deployment**
   - Deployed the updated backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   - Verified the backend is running correctly
   - Confirmed the CORS configuration is working properly

2. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Built the frontend with the updated API configuration
   - Pushed the changes to GitHub
   - The frontend will be automatically deployed by Amplify

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the API communication, try the following:

1. Check the browser console for any CORS errors
2. Verify the backend is running and accessible
3. Confirm the frontend is using the correct API endpoint
4. Check the network tab in the browser developer tools for any API errors

## Key Findings

1. **HTTPS Not Supported**: The backend server on Elastic Beanstalk does not have HTTPS configured. Attempts to connect via HTTPS resulted in connection timeouts.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The frontend was attempting to use HTTPS to connect to the backend, but the backend only supports HTTP. This caused the connection to fail.

3. **Mixed Content Issues**: Modern browsers block mixed content (HTTP requests from HTTPS pages). To work around this, we've configured the Amplify proxy to handle the HTTP requests securely.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement HTTPS for the backend API using AWS Certificate Manager
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for API operations
3. Implement API request retries for better reliability
4. Add API request caching for better performance
