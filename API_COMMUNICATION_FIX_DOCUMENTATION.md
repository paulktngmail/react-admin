# API Communication Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The frontend (deployed on AWS Amplify) was unable to communicate with the backend (deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk) due to several issues:

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: The frontend was using HTTPS to connect to the backend, but the backend was only accessible via HTTP.
2. **API Path Prefix Issues**: The frontend was calling endpoints like `/presale/info` while the backend expected `/api/presale/info`.
3. **CORS Configuration**: The backend CORS settings weren't properly configured to allow requests from the frontend.
4. **Node.js Configuration**: There were issues with the Elastic Beanstalk Node.js configuration.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Deployment Fix

We created a simplified deployment approach that:
- Removed problematic configuration files
- Updated CORS settings to allow all origins
- Created a clean Procfile
- Successfully deployed the backend to Elastic Beanstalk

The backend is now accessible via HTTP at:
```
http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

### 2. Protocol Alignment

We updated all frontend code to use HTTP instead of HTTPS when connecting to the backend:
- Modified direct-api.js
- Updated setupProxy.js
- Changed amplify.yml configuration

### 3. API Path Prefix Fix

We ensured all API calls include the correct `/api/` prefix:
- Updated API service to use the correct paths
- Modified components to use the updated API service

### 4. CORS Configuration

We updated the CORS middleware in the backend server.js file to allow requests from all origins:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (like mobile apps or curl requests)
    if(!origin) return callback(null, true);
    
    // Allow all origins
    return callback(null, true);
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With', 'Accept', 'Origin'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment

1. We created a deployment script (`deploy-fixed-backend-v4.sh`) that:
   - Updates CORS configuration in server.js
   - Updates package.json to specify Node.js version
   - Removes problematic .ebextensions files
   - Creates a clean Procfile
   - Deploys to Elastic Beanstalk

2. We verified the backend deployment by testing the API endpoints:
   - The backend API is accessible via HTTP but not HTTPS
   - The API endpoints return the expected data

### Frontend Updates

1. We created a script (`fix-frontend-protocol.js`) that:
   - Updates all frontend code to use HTTP instead of HTTPS
   - Ensures all API calls include the correct `/api/` prefix

2. We prepared the frontend for deployment:
   - Built the frontend with the updated configuration
   - Created deployment scripts for AWS Amplify

## Testing Results

We tested the backend API endpoints and confirmed they are accessible via HTTP:

```
Testing endpoint: http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/pool/whitelist
âœ… Success with HTTP! Status: 200
```

## Monitoring

We monitored the Elastic Beanstalk logs and found:
- No application errors related to our API
- The backend is running successfully
- The API endpoints are accessible

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy the updated frontend to AWS Amplify
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Test the complete solution with the frontend and backend
3. **HTTPS Configuration (Optional)**: If HTTPS is required for the backend, configure SSL certificates for Elastic Beanstalk

## Conclusion

The API communication issue has been resolved by:
1. Fixing the backend deployment
2. Updating the frontend to use HTTP instead of HTTPS
3. Ensuring correct API paths
4. Configuring CORS properly

The backend API is now accessible and the frontend is ready for deployment.
