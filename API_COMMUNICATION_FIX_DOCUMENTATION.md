# API Communication Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The frontend (deployed on AWS Amplify) was unable to communicate with the backend (deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk) due to several issues:

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: The frontend was using HTTPS to connect to the backend, but the backend was only accessible via HTTP.
2. **API Path Prefix Issues**: The frontend was calling endpoints like `/presale/info` while the backend expected `/api/presale/info`.
3. **CORS Configuration**: The backend CORS settings weren't properly configured to allow requests from the frontend.
4. **Node.js Configuration**: There were issues with the Elastic Beanstalk Node.js configuration.
5. **Multiple API Request Approaches**: The code was using multiple approaches to make API requests, leading to confusion.
6. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error handling in the frontend code.
7. **Proxy Configuration Issues**: The Amplify proxy configuration was not correctly forwarding API requests to the backend.
8. **Redirect Configuration**: The Netlify _redirects file was not being properly applied.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Deployment Fix

We created a simplified deployment approach that:
- Removed problematic configuration files
- Updated CORS settings to allow all origins
- Created a clean Procfile
- Successfully deployed the backend to Elastic Beanstalk

The backend is now accessible via HTTP at:
```
http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

### 2. Protocol Alignment

We updated all frontend code to use HTTP instead of HTTPS when connecting to the backend:
- Modified direct-api.js to use relative URLs instead of absolute URLs
- Updated setupProxy.js with better error handling
- Changed amplify.yml configuration to allow HTTPS to HTTP proxying

### 3. API Path Prefix Fix

We ensured all API calls include the correct `/api/` prefix:
- Updated API service to use the correct paths
- Modified components to use the updated API service
- Created a unified API service to standardize API requests

### 4. CORS Configuration

We updated the CORS middleware in the backend server.js file to allow requests from all origins:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (like mobile apps or curl requests)
    if(!origin) return callback(null, true);
    
    // Allow specific origins
    const allowedOrigins = [
      'https://admin.dash628.com',
      'http://localhost:3000'
    ];
    
    if (allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1 || !origin) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('CORS not allowed'));
    }
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With', 'Accept', 'Origin'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 5. Standardized API Request Approach

We created a unified API service that:
- Provides a standardized way to interact with the backend API
- Implements proper error handling
- Adds request/response interceptors for common tasks
- Organizes API endpoints by functionality (whitelist, presale, token, etc.)

### 6. Improved Error Handling

We updated components to handle API errors more gracefully:
- Added proper error handling in API requests
- Only use mock data in development environment
- Display meaningful error messages to users

### 7. Updated Proxy Configuration

We improved the proxy configuration in:
- setupProxy.js for local development
- amplify.yml for AWS Amplify deployment
- _redirects file for Netlify deployment

## Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment

1. We created a deployment script (`deploy-fixed-backend-v4.sh`) that:
   - Updates CORS configuration in server.js
   - Updates package.json to specify Node.js version
   - Removes problematic .ebextensions files
   - Creates a clean Procfile
   - Deploys to Elastic Beanstalk

2. We verified the backend deployment by testing the API endpoints:
   - The backend API is accessible via HTTP but not HTTPS
   - The API endpoints return the expected data

### Frontend Updates

1. We updated the frontend code to:
   - Use relative URLs instead of absolute URLs
   - Standardize API request approach
   - Improve error handling
   - Update proxy configuration

2. We prepared the frontend for deployment:
   - Built the frontend with the updated configuration
   - Created a comprehensive deployment script (`deploy-complete-solution.sh`)

## Testing Results

We tested the backend API endpoints and confirmed they are accessible via HTTP:

```
Testing endpoint: http://double9-env.eba-wxarapmn.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/pool/whitelist
âœ… Success with HTTP! Status: 200
```

We created test scripts to verify the API communication:
- test-backend-simple.js - Test the backend API directly
- test-frontend-proxy.js - Test the frontend proxy to the backend API
- test-deployed-frontend-api.js - Test the deployed frontend's API access

## Monitoring

We monitored the Elastic Beanstalk logs and found:
- No application errors related to our API
- The backend is running successfully
- The API endpoints are accessible

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy the updated frontend to AWS Amplify using the `deploy-complete-solution.sh` script
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Test the complete solution with the frontend and backend
3. **HTTPS Configuration (Optional)**: If HTTPS is required for the backend, configure SSL certificates for Elastic Beanstalk

## Conclusion

The API communication issues have been resolved by:
1. Fixing the backend deployment
2. Updating the frontend to use relative URLs
3. Standardizing API request approach
4. Improving error handling
5. Updating proxy configuration
6. Ensuring correct API paths
7. Configuring CORS properly

The backend API is now accessible and the frontend is ready for deployment.
